# EXSIM - EXCHANGE SIMULATOR
Exsim helps run back testing and paper testing of trading algorithms against an exchange simulator which runs in "real time".
The quoted "real time", and the real purpose behind this application is to be able to catch intra candle price movements that are usually missed with the classical back testing.

### TODO
- Add UI with trading view to mimic a sped up exchange
- Add order inputs through API
- (Maybe?) Add websocket support to mimic fully a real exchange
